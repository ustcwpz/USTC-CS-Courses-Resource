	This file provides a sample implementation of an LC3 extension and is designed to
	be used with the ExtensionTest.asm assembly file.  This extension performs the
	following operations:
		
		* The extension uses Interrupt x81 as a one second timer.  If the time
		  since the last interrupt call is more than one second, interrupt x81
		  is fired.  Location x1000 is used as the interrupt enable address.
		  Interrupt x81 is enabled only in location x1000 is non zero.

		* The extension implements the reserved opcode as an instruction that
		  should write a random number in the range of 0 to 9 in the register
		  indicated in bits 9 to 11 in the instruction.

	  The corresponding ExtensionSample.asm sets the interrupt handler and enables
	  interrupts.  The interrupt handler calls the reserved opcode then writes the
	  random number to the console.
